# Vatsal Gupta - Machine Learning Enthusiast
# Hi, I'm **Vatsal Gupta**, a Master's student in Environmental Engineering at Leibniz University Hannover, specializing in machine learning and data-driven modelling. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. I'm actively looking for internship opportunities to further my machine learning and AI skills.


## Projects

### [1. Image Style Transfer with Vision Transformers (ViT)](https://github.com/diyiiyiii/StyTR-2)
- Implemented an image style-transfer model based on the STyTR2 paper using Vision Transformers (ViT) in PyTorch.
- **Tools**: PyTorch, Python, Vision Transformers
- **Description**: Developed a model that applies artistic styles to images by learning content and style features. Fine-tuned for optimal image quality.

### [2. Music Generation with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/tree/master/lab1)
- Created an RNN model that generates musical compositions by predicting the next note in a sequence using ABC notation.
- **Tools**: Python, TensorFlow, RNN
- **Description**: The model was trained on a classical music dataset to generate original music compositions based on learned patterns.

### 3. Greybox Model for Predicting PVD-Coated Tool Performance
- Developing a Greybox model that predicts the performance of PVD-coated tools in manufacturing processes.
- **Tools**: Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis
- **Description**: Combined physics-based modelling with data-driven approaches to improve tool selection and optimize manufacturing parameters.
